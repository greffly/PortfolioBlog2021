          In 2019 I made a bold career move from selling beer to being a
          software engineer. I got lucky, because not only do I love the work,
          but I love writing about it, talking about it, and encouraging others
          to make their own bold career changes.

          I'm always happy to talk, partially because I'm passionate about tech
          and alternate career paths, and partially because I am a social
          extrovert.
