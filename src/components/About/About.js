          <p>
            In 2019 I made a bold career move from selling beer to being a
            software engineer. I got lucky, because not only do I love the work,
            but I love writing about it, talking about it, and encouraging
            others to make their own bold career changes.
          </p>

            I'm currently a "full stack" Software Engineer with a passion for
            frontend. I work in Angular, C# and AWS, while my side projects are
            mostly in React, and I dabbled in Gatsby and GraphQL to make this
            site. Other passions and hobbies include: thinking about UX, writing
            about my experiences in tech, playing with colors and design for way
            too long, and renovating my recently purchased 1930s home in
            Portland, Oregon.
