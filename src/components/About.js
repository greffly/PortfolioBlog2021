        <p>
          In 2019 I made a bold career move from selling beer to being a
          software engineer. I got lucky, because not only do I love the work,
          but I love writing about it, talking about it, and encouraging others
          to make their own bold career changes.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I'm currently a "full stack" Software Engineer with a passion for
          frontend. I work in Angular, C# and AWS, while my side projects are
          mostly in React, and I dabbled in Gatsby and GraphQL to make this
          site. Other passions and hobbies include: thinking about UX, writing
          about my experiences in tech, playing with colors and design for way
          too long, and renovating my recently purchased 1930s home in Portland,
          Oregon.
